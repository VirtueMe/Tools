  <title>The Big Honey Hunt | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;The Bear family has run out of honey. Will Papa Bear get more at the honey store, as Mama suggests, or does he have a better idea? Join Papa and Small Bear on &lt;em&gt;The Big Honey Hunt&lt;/em&gt;, and see how following a bee to the right honey tree can be very tricky—and very funny. The very first book about the Bear family from the creative minds of authors and illustrators Stan and Jan Berenstain, &lt;em&gt;The Big Honey Hunt&lt;/em&gt; is one sweet tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tie-in Activity: Play a game of follow the “bee.” Use a stuffed toy (the “bee”) to lead your baby on a safe journey around the house. Keep moving the object so that your child can follow it. You might have it finally “land” on a book, so that the game can end with the sweet reward of reading.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
