  <title>Oh, the Places You’ll Go! | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;This book, the last published before Dr. Seuss’s death, is inspirational for readers of all ages—especially for those about to set off into a new part of their life. Whether it’s the birth of a new baby, the first day of school or the last, this book lets readers take a deep breath and get ready for the next adventure. The rollicking verse happily tells readers about the great heights they’re sure to soar to, while also being realistic by warning readers to expect some lumps and bumps along the way. And in the end… “will you succeed? Yes! You will Indeed! (98 and ¾ percent guaranteed.)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Make a biography map. List a few of your child’s experiences—such as learning to walk, or tie his shoes, or ride a bike—in a mazelike diagram so your child can follow his path to success. (Be sure to include a few “bumps” in the road, too.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
