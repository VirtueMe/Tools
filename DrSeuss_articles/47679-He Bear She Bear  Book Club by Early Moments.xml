  <title>He Bear She Bear | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;"He" and "she" authors Stan and Jan Berenstain inspire readers of &lt;em&gt;He Bear She Bear&lt;/em&gt; by asking the question: What will Brother Bear and Sister Bear be when they grow up? The answer is anything the young bears want to be, whether a he bear or she bear! From building bridges and climbing poles to racing cars and digging holes, there are lots of things that a he bear or a she bear can do or be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tie-in Activity: Use this story as a springboard for a dress-up game with your child. What would he or she like to be? Or take a few extra moments to watch others do their jobs as you take your baby around town with you. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
