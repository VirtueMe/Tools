  <title>Arthur’s Reading Race | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;Based on the popular &lt;strong&gt;Arthur&lt;/strong&gt; series by Marc Brown comes this story about Arthur and his little sister, D.W. When Arthur offers to teach D.W. to read, she claims that she already knows how. So a skeptical Arthur challenges her to read ten words on their way through town. If she can, he’ll buy them both an ice cream. Readers will cheer for D.W. as she tackles the task of Arthur's reading race, and even teaches her big brother some words in the process!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tie-in Activity: Challenge your child to a real-world reading race as you run your daily errands. (Ice cream is optional.) Or set up a baby-safe race by scattering a few toys around the room and asking your baby to crawl to (or pick up) a specific item. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
