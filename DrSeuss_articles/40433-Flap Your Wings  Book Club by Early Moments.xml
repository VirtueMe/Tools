  <title>Flap Your Wings | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;In the classic children’s book &lt;em&gt;Flap Your Wings&lt;/em&gt;, author P.D. Eastman’s two birds are in for a surprise when a young boy finds an egg and puts it in their empty nest. Though Mrs. Bird doesn’t recognize the egg, Mr. Bird insists it must be theirs. So the Birds hatch the egg and take care of “Junior,” who is perhaps the funniest-looking bird ever! But what will happen to Junior when it’s time to flap his wings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tie-in Activity: Children love to pretend to fly. If you are able, carefully support your child in your arms and “fly” him around the room. (Of course, always be sure to support your back and his neck and head.) Encourage him to “flap his wings” if he can. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
