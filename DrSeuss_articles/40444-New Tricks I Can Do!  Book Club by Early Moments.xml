  <title>New Tricks I Can Do! | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;By now everyone has seen Spot and his amazing, color-changing spots. So the circus thinks it’s time for Spot to go in the classic &lt;em&gt;New Tricks I Can Do!&lt;/em&gt; But once again Spot knows a few more tricks—and shows them off to his friends. He can change color completely, change the shape of his spots, and even turn plaid! Is the circus still the place for him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tie-in Activity: Try some new tricks at painting time. Instead of brushes, use old combs, rubber balls, sponges, or any other safe, washable item to make interesting new textures. Or let your baby “paint” with baby food on her highchair tray—messy but fun!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
