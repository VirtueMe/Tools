  <title>Stop, Train, Stop! | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;Thomas the Tank Engine puffs along his regular branch line every day at just the right speed, stopping at all the stations to let people on and off. But what happens when he decides to race from the start of his branch line to the finish without a single stop? Bumps and thumps are in store for everyone—as well as a lesson for Thomas in &lt;em&gt;Stop, Train, Stop!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tie-in Activity: If your little one is already walking and running, try playing this game in a safe, open area. Let your toddler move as fast as he can, then say, “Stop, train, stop!” Your toddler should stop in his tracks until you say, “Go, train, go!” Don’t forget to reverse roles, so your child gets to tell you what to do!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
