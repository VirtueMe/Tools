  <title>The Foot Book | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;Readers meet many different feet in this Bright and Early Books story by Dr. Seuss. The rhythmic verse and silly pictures will delight babies just discovering their feet. And the easy-to-read words are perfect for a child who is just getting on her feet as a reader. Either way, readers will have a reason to smile, wiggle some toes, and see that feet are neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Play a shoe matching game with a pair of soft baby shoes and one different baby shoe. Give your baby one shoe from the pair, then show him the other two shoes. Ask him which shoe matches—helping as needed. As your baby grows, you can add more shoes to make the game more challenging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
