  <title>The Shape Of Me and Other Stuff | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;This wonderful story by Dr. Seuss rejoices in the uniqueness of all things, because everything has a different shape. From you and me to a camel and a key, no two things ever have quite the same shape, and that’s a reason to shout &lt;em&gt;hooray!&lt;/em&gt; And in a departure from his other books, the story is illustrated with silhouettes, so readers really can see the shape of things and other stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;Tie-in Activity: As you read through the story, pause and point to a shape to let your child guess the object before you read the word. You might also read this book outside together on a sunny day, then look at clouds—what shapes to you see? Or introduce your baby to his shadow, showing how it can grow bigger, smaller, or disappear in the shade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
