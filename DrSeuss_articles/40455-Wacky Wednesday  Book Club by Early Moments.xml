  <title>Wacky Wednesday | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;Wednesday is wacky in this Dr. Seuss tale. The day starts with a shoe on the wall and bananas growing on an apple tree. Before you know it, there's a palm tree in a toilet, and faucets that are upside down. What's going on here? No one seems to be seeing wacky things except our befuddled narrator. Kids and parents will have a wonderful time counting along as they search for all the things that are wrong on each page of &lt;em&gt;Wacky Wednesday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tie-in Activity: This book is an activity all on its own. But consider playing a real-life version of it in a room in your house. Create five wacky things in a room (a shoe in an empty pot on a bookshelf) while your child is out of the room. Then see if your child can spot what’s out of place. Don’t forget to reverse roles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
