&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;span id="Blue"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Heading2"&gt;&lt;span id="Blue"&gt;by Dr. Seuss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;Are you smarter than the Cat in the Hat? Find out as you and your child try to answer all sorts of questions, such as “What was George Washington’s favorite TV program?” and “What comes out of a tree?” and “What is it that comes out of a WHAT-IS-IT?” Dr. Seuss brings his sense of playfulness to this delightful book, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cat's Quizzer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which challenges readers to think and think again, and best of all, imagine. The variety of questions and quizzes—some logical, some trivial, and some just plain silly—means that everyone will have a chance to get a few right. And just in case, kind Dr. Seuss has even provided the answers, which are often just as silly and fun as the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;strong style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;Tie-in Activity: If you’re reading this book with a younger child, read the questions and then work out the solutions aloud, rephrasing questions so your child can help you complete the answer. For example, your child may not know who George Washington is, so you could say, “George Washington lived a long time ago. He didn’t have a TV. Do you think he could have a favorite TV show if he didn’t have a TV?” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
