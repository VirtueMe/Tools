  <title>The Cat in the Hat Comes Back | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;By November 1958, &lt;em&gt;The Cat in the Hat&lt;/em&gt; had sold more than 300,000 copies. Its success prompted Seuss, his wife Helen Geisel, and Phyllis Cerf to found a new type of reader called Beginner Books. It was time for a sequel. When Seuss wrote &lt;em&gt;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&lt;/em&gt;, The New York Times said, "the new antics of &lt;em&gt;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&lt;/em&gt; are just as funny and unexpected as in the original story, &lt;em&gt;The Cat in the Hat&lt;/em&gt;." The book, the Times said, had the same "hypnotic rhythms" as the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Hat bowling? It’s easy. Paint three (or more) toilet-paper tubes red and let dry. Then add two white stripes to copy the Cat’s hat. Set the tubes (“pins”) upright to form a small triangle, and let your baby roll a ball to knock them down. For an older child, write letters of the alphabet on sticky notes and place under the “pins.” If the child knocks a pin down, she gets that letter. Replace it with a new letter and set up the pins. See if she can get all 26 letters to “win.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
