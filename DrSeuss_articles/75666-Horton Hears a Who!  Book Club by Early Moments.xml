  <title>Horton Hears a Who! | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;This classic story is one of the most beloved ever written by Dr. Seuss. While enjoying the cool of the pool, Horton the elephant discovers a whole world the size of a speck of dust! Because of his large ears, only Horton can hear the tiny Whos living there. But the other animals in the jungle think that Horton is crazy for talking to Whos who are “not.” Wrapped in the lyrical rhymes, expert storytelling, and comical art of Dr. Seuss are easy-to-understand lessons in loyalty, faithfulness, making a difference, and most of all, tolerance. As Horton wisely points out, “A person’s a person, no matter how small.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Have your child imagine that he is a resident of Who-ville. Ask him what kind of noise he would make to be heard. Then (if you’re prepared) let him make that noise as loud as he can!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
