  <title>Fox in Socks | Book Club by Early Moments</title>
  <ingress>&lt;p&gt;"Take it slowly," Dr. Seuss warns at the beginning of &lt;em&gt;Fox in Socks&lt;/em&gt;. "This book is dangerous." Published in 1965, &lt;em&gt;Fox in Socks&lt;/em&gt; is Seuss at his most brilliant. From the first page to the last, this tongue-tying, raucous-rhyming book will have your child in stitches and your tongue in knots as the Fox in Socks tries to get Mr. Knox to play a rhyming game. The rhymes get more complex as you read. "Stop it! Stop it! I can't say such silly stuff, sir," says Knox. In the end, he catches on and so will you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="color: #ca2d92;"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Help your baby pick up the rhythms of the verses by clapping her hands as you read. Or choose a rhyme and try to say it as fast as you can—then see if your older child can say it, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ingress>
