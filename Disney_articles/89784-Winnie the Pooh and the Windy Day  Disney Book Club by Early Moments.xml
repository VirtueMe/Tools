&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winnie the Pooh and the Windy Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on A. A. Milne's classic tale, the beloved characters from the Hundred Acre Wood are all featured in this action-packed adventure, which reinforces the importance of bravery, loyalty, and selflessness. On one blustery day, Pooh and his friends find their world swept upside-down by gusts of wind, sending Piglet flying high into the air and uprooting Owl’s home. That night, a torrential downpour floods the Hundred Acre Wood, putting both Piglet and Pooh in peril. During their escapade, Piglet gives up his beloved house for the homeless Owl, and Pooh unwittingly rescues Piglet. By the time all are safely reunited with their friends, Pooh and Piglet are celebrated as heroes for their valiant efforts and momentous sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Go over weather safety procedures with your child, outlining the courses of action that should be taken in the event of a flood, tornado, windstorm, or other dangerous situation. Be sure to stress that you hope that your family will never have to use these procedures, but it's important to know what to do to stay safe in case of an emergency.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
