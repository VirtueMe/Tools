&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goofy and the Pirate Treasure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this seafaring tale, Goofy and Mickey find an old pirate treasure map that belonged to Goofy’s great-grandfather, Goofy the Great. In order to help the younger Goofy come up with the money to save his rundown house, he and Mickey embark on a search for the long-lost treasure. Their expedition takes them across rivers, up cliffs, and into caves and tunnels, but doesn’t lead them to any loot. Just as they’ve resigned themselves to the fact that Goofy will have to give up his house, the friends come across a solid-gold treasure chest in the attic, and Goofy has all the money he needs to make his house beautiful again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Spark your child’s imagination by sending him on a good old-fashioned scavenger hunt. You don’t need anything fancy or elaborate—just place a few hidden clues in strategic places around the house, making sure that each one leads to the next. Alternately, you could give simply give your child a list of things to collect in the house or yard (time limit is optional).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
