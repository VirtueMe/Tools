&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brave Little Tailor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woven from threads of adventure and bravery, this delightful tale is sure to captivate young readers. Mickey Mouse industriously sews away in his little tailor shop, unaware that the townspeople are threatened by the presence of a giant. When buzzing flies annoy Mickey, he wields a flyswatter and kills seven with a single blow. Hearing him boast of his accomplishment, the townspeople misconstrue Mickey’s feat by thinking that he killed giants instead of flies. Word of the little tailor’s victory spreads to the king, who calls on Mickey to save the townspeople from the giant in exchange for the hand of the beautiful Princess Minnie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-In Activity: Brainstorm with your child, asking her to discover “giant sized” uses for common household items. Encourage her to use her imagination by asking questions like, “How would a giant use a bathtub?” or “How do you think a giant brushes his teeth?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
