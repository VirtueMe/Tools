&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goofy and the Enchanted Castle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Goofy comes across two mischievous princes, Harold and Gerald, he agrees to join them for an adventure. It soon becomes apparent that the brothers are up to no good, and Goofy urges them not to harm the animals they meet along the way. When the trio comes across an old castle that has been put under a spell, the king assigns Harold and Gerald impossible tasks to complete to break the spell. When both fail, Goofy is nominated to give it a try. With a little help from the ants, ducks, and bees he saved earlier, Goofy is successful in completing his tasks, and is invited to remain in the castle with the king for a congratulatory feast. Young readers will learn the importance of sticking up for others and discouraging mean-spirited behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Ask your child to think of a time when she was faced with completing a task that seemed very difficult, or perhaps even impossible. How did she overcome the challenge, and how did she feel when she succeeded?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
