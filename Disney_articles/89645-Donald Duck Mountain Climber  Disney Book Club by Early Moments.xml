&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donald Duck: Mountain Climber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comical antics ensue when Donald Duck takes his nephews along on a mountain climbing trip. Huey, Dewey, and Louie are disappointed when their uncle leaves them behind at the inn, stubbornly refusing to let them climb. Despite how long it’s been since his last climb, Donald is confident in his prowess—until he meets an unlikely guide, Goofy. Donald soon regrets his decision to follow Goofy up the mountain, an escapade that ends with Donald dangling perilously from a cliff and getting bombarded in a huge snowball. Donald gets a lesson in humility when he ends up getting rescued by the nephews he excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Ask your child to list a few activities or adventures she would like to try someday, perhaps when she’s a little older. Some examples might include riding a roller coaster, swimming underwater, or flying on an airplane. Together, imagine what the experience would be like.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
