&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WALL-E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in the year 2700, this futuristic story follows the adventures of WALL-E, the last remaining robot among a crew that was originally sent down to Earth to clean up all of the trash that has made the planet uninhabitable. All humans are now living in a massive spaceship, Axiom, biding their time until Earth is restored to a livable status. Over the centuries, the lonely WALL-E has developed an obsession with earthly artifacts, rivaled only by his affinity for EVE, a sleek new robot sent down from space on a different mission. WALL-E hitches a ride back out to space with EVE and enters the Axiom spaceship, where he comes face to face with the humans he’s been tasked with saving. This imaginative story is sure to spark the imaginations of young readers who are intrigued by space, while teaching valuable lessons of conservation and ecology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: In the story, WALL-E planted the Earth’s last remaining plant in an old shoe. Help your child plant the seedling of her choice in an old shoe, pot, or mason jar. Teach her how to provide it with the proper amounts of water and sunlight, and then monitor its growth together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
