&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dinosaur&lt;/em&gt; is the heartwarming story of Aladar, an iguanodon separated from his family at birth and raised by a family of lemurs. When a comet strikes Earth, Aladar must take the lemurs across the harrowing landscape to the safe haven of the "Nesting Grounds." On the way, Aladar and his adopted family meet up with a group of dinosaurs that are also on the same journey. This group of unlikely friends band together to fight off a variety of hardships. In the end, they forge a friendship that not even a comet can destroy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: If your child is older, help him research on the Internet the names of the various dinosaur species mentioned in the book. Have him tell you some facts about each dinosaur, such as how big they were and what they ate. If your child is younger, help him mold and play with the main characters in the book out of play dough.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
