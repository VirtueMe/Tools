&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the 2006 animated movie, this imaginative tale recounts the adventures of an unlikely clan of zoo friends and their mission to rescue Ryan, an eleven-year old lion cub, who is inadvertently shipped to the wild. The tale unfolds with Samson, a majestic zoo lion, who tells his son, Ryan, stories of life in the wild. Later, Ryan and his friends accidentally cause the zoo’s gazelles to stampede, and when the young lion slips off to sulk in a green transport box, he winds up getting shipped to Africa. When a pigeon clues Ryan’s zoo friends in on his fate, a rescue ensues. With the help of his friends, Ryan is reunited with Samson, who shares the real story of his life. Young readers will gain a profound appreciation of friendship, and learn that it’s okay to be themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
