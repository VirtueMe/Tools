&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lambert the Sheepish Lion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this delightful tale of courage and strength, Lambert the lion achieves greatness in the face of adversity. Mistakenly delivered by the stork, Lambert found growing up in a family of sheep to be a real challenge. He was raised to nosh on grass instead of meat, to baa rather than roar, and to head-butt rather than bare his teeth. Though Lambert’s upbringing made him a target of ridicule among the other lions, he soon earned their respect by saving the sheep from becoming a wolf’s next meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Ask your child to list the challenges that would be created by other unlikely animal pairings, such as a dog being raised in a family of cats or a mouse growing up in a family of elephants. Encourage her to talk about how each animal might adapt, and then draw pictures of the blended animal families.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
