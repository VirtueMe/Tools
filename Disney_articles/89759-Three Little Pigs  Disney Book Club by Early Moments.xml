&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three Little Pigs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 1930s, this timeless classic has delighted children across the world with its rich characters and recognizable rhyming verses. The famous story of the three little pigs and their struggles to elude the big, bad wolf has become a universal staple of most children’s home libraries. When the first two pig’s houses, constructed of hay and sticks, are blown down by the wolf’s huffing and puffing, the third brother’s brick house holds strong. The underlying message is clear: those who work the hardest and take the time to complete the job right will ultimately reap the most benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: For a fun and creative craft, help your child build her own little pig houses using materials around your home, such as popsicle sticks, toothpicks, cotton balls, and pebbles and sticks collected from the yard. Ask her which is the strongest and why. For younger children, try building different structures and letting her try to huff and puff each of them down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
