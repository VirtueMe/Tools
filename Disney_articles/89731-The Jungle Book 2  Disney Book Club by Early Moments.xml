&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this long-awaited sequel to the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; debut, Mowgli is trying to get acclimated to the Man Village after years of living with his jungle friends. When he decides to return to the jungle for a visit with his old friend Baloo, his new friend Shanti is concerned and follows him. When Mowgli realizes his antics have put Shanti in danger, he’s faced with a tough decision: returning to his exciting life with Baloo and his jungle friends or living a safe, simple life with Shanti back in the Man Village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Stage your own jungle safari by exploring a nature center or forest near your home. Ask your child to point out animals, bugs, and other interesting things he sees, keeping in mind that some plants can pose a hazard and should be avoided. If you don't have easy access to either of those places, print out photos of interesting jungle dwellers and create a jungle in your very own living room for them to explore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<format /><visible>false</visible><weight /><available /><priority /><recommendedAge /><url>/Templates/Default/Pages/Article.aspx?id=89731</url><image1></image1></text>
