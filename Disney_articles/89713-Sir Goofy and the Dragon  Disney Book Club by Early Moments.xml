&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sir Goofy and the Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mickey’s nephews visit Goofy and admire his majestic sword, he mesmerizes the boys with the fabled story of his great-great grandfather, Sir Goofylad, who forged the sword himself in his smithy. When King Mickey’s knights were too cowardly to defeat the vicious dragon who had terrorized the kingdom, Sir Goofylad volunteered to give it a try. Once he met the dragon, he realized the creature wasn’t vicious at all, but only needed someone to help fix his hurt paw. When Sir Goofylad obliges, the two return peacefully to the kingdom as friends. To reward him for “taming” the dragon, Mickey makes Goofy a knight. Young readers will be just as captivated by Goofy’s tale as Mickey’s two young nephews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Ask your child to think of a time when she was scared of a person or situation, and then realized her fears were unfounded. Encourage her to recognize how she was enriched by the situation, and what lessons they took away from it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
