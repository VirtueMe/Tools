&lt;p&gt;In this enjoyable sequel to the timeless Disney classic, Lady and Tramp are happily raising their new family: three well-behaved pups and one mischievous pup, Scamp, whose nose for curiosity gets him into plenty of trouble. Scamp wants to become a hero like his dad, a goal he finally achieves when his adventures inadvertently lead him to Aunt Sara’s missing kitten. When the kitten follows him home and back to her relieved owner, Scamp is immediately celebrated by the entire family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Together with your child, make a list of his favorite heroes. They can be from stories, movies, or even from real life. Ask him to identify the traits or accomplishments he admires in each, and point out examples of scenarios when he has exhibited them himself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
