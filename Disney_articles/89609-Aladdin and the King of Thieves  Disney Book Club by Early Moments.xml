&lt;p&gt;Based on the third installment of the wildly popular Disney movie series, this action-packed book follows the adventures of the ill-fated Aladdin and Jasmine. After their wedding is ruined by a raid of the Forty Thieves, Aladdin sets out on an expedition to track down his father, who he discovers is the leader of the same evil group that carried out the raid. As the storyline progresses, we discover that the seemingly malicious actions of Aladdin’s father, Cassis, were actually motivated by his love for his son. At the end of the book, Aladdin and Jasmine finally get married, with a renewed appreciation for family loyalty and sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Turn a regular blanket into a magic carpet, and hop on for a “ride” with your child. As you “fly” through your pretend world, encourage your child to use his imagination to point out what he sees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
