&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Heading1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sindbad the Sailor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a boring rainy day, Grandma Duck entertains Huey, Dewey, and Louie with the quirky story of Sindbad. The timeless Disney character, Mickey, takes on the role of Sindbad, a poor boy who is driven by his desire for riches. His quest for fortune leads him to numerous adventures, including a shipwreck that washes him up onto a beautiful island. After catching a ride on the back of a giant bird, he finds himself back in the city, where he hears of the sultan’s offer of a reward to anyone who brings him coconuts. Sindbad bravely confronts some giant monkeys to gather the coveted coconuts, which ultimately earn him a generous reward from the sultan. His cleverness and bravery allow him to return home to live in comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="COLOR: #ca2d92"&gt;Tie-in Activity: Ask your child to identify something he wants very badly, and then encourage him to make a plan for how to get it. What sacrifices will he need to make along the way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
